## Bryan West

I am a Ph.D. candidate in social psychology working with [David Pizarro](http://www.peezer.net/) (Cornell), [Tom Gilovich](http://blogs.cornell.edu/tgilovich/) (Cornell), and [Melissa Ferguson](http://melissaferguson.squarespace.com/) (Yale). Using a combination of experimental methods and large-scale survey data, I study how moral judgment, political ideology, and religious belief interact with and influence one another, and how these relationships impact intergroup behavior, social change, and how we perceive others.

Before starting my graduate work at [Cornell](https://psychology.cornell.edu/), I completed a post-baccalaureate certificate in Psychology & Social Behavior at [UC Irvine](https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/), where I worked with [Jacqueline Chen](https://jacquelinemchen.wixsite.com/sciplab), [Paul Piff](https://paulpiff.wixsite.com/meshlab), [Pete Ditto](https://sites.uci.edu/peterdittolab/), and [Azim Shariff](https://sharifflab.com/).
