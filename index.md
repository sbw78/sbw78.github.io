This website is work in progress and something of an experiment, so there's very little useful information and a lot of broken stuff.

I am testing out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a platform for hosting a website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I currently run my [current academic website](https://sbwest.com/) using the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/) with a theme/CMS by [Wowchemy](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic), host it on GitHub, and deploy it via Netlify. [It's much simpler than it sounds, really](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/hugo-github-quickstart/).
